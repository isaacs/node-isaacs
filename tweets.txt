CommonJS : Node :: TC-39 : ???
#jsmodules Step 5: Build a package manager.  <fin>
#jsmodules  Step 4: Focus on delighting production users, making their lives better, rather than any "theoretical" necessities or concerns.
#jsmodules  Step 3: Say "no" to features 3 times as often as you say "yes".
#jsmodules  Step 2: Iterate relentlessly, with code running in production. Make an army of bugs, and fix them one by one.
#jsmodules Step 1: Ignore people who are not involved with that problem set. (Including and @substack and other noders, probably.)
#jsmodules Step 0: Pick a radically small set of problems to solve as simply as possible.
#jsmodules TC-39 should copy the process that made Node's module system great.

Important part: agreement = cost dev activity = return  Most platforms are not frugal. Minimize agreement-scope, and make decisions quickly.
A software platform ideally increases developer productivity, but does so at the cost of demanding agreement re its fundamental paradigms.
Consensus *feels* relevant, because when our software was written, the individual was much less powerful, and disagreement was often fatal.

I'm as anti-m$ as the next mac/*nix user, but the EU court's crap is plain ridiculous http://rurl.org/96t No one's forcing you to buy a PC!!
Interesting that "Love You To" comes right after "I'm Only Sleeping." A conflicted message that makes Revolver such a great album.
Just realized that I got Illustrator installed, but not licensed.  Trotting back to the walk-up window...
On second thought, going to just try Illustrator free for 30 days.  Lets hope thats enough time for IT to come through with a serial number!
Got the file opened, and even found the fonts it needs!  We're in business.
Physically hacked into the network in Cherry Orchard's business center.
gonna actually hit url's before lunch closes today.  yippee!!
Working to a spec I can't always see, hours of window gazing, punctuated by moments of intense productivity.
Waiting for Illustrator and Parallels upgrades at the IT walk-up counter.
Installing Illustrator
Failed.  Trying again...
Back at my desk with Illustrator installed.  Hooray!
Wanna cut global warming? Skip the hybrid and go vegan. http://rurl.org/93l(Not that I plan to get a hybrid OR ditch meat, of course.)
Anyone out there know how to find out who's using your shared iTunes library?  I'm always fraught with curiosity when I see that alert.
esurance: A link called "Make a Payment" should be un-missable when I log into your site.  "Payment Status" just doesn't have the same draw.
Just finished the 33 levels of bloxorz. Now i'll have something to brag about to my grandkids some day!
It's annoying sometimes that humans and computers represent time so differently. Especially weeks. A week is actually 3-13 days.
Happy Programmers' Day! (256th day of the year)
Best comment today: // TODO: Do this.
We're living in the 21st century, and people STILL wage war to impress invisible superheroes who live in outer space! http://rurl.org/8xr

Open Letter to All who Park in Y! Main Campus: If my Landrover fits in 1 spot, your Civic has no business taking up two. Stay in the lines!!
best thing to do is pick something you have fun doing, learn the shit out of it, and go pimp yourself out to the highest bidder.
Every few days, I forget JSON completely and spend 15 minutes debugging some stupid syntax error. Its sad that senility can set at 28.
Sneak preview of next week's post for all my twitter followers: http://rurl.org/8vn
Wow, I got two consecutive rurl.org urls. They must not be getting too much usage.
Keep receiving comps from UED with interesting headlines that are distracting with interestingness.  Need to use some lipsum text...
Sullying up my mac with internet explorer 5.2.3 to use our corporate software request tool. It's a sad sad day.
No, i would not like to set the most crash-prone bug ridden version of Internet Explorer as my default browser, thank you very much.
omg, msie won't even start up. the default homepage (msn.com) makes it crash. We &heart; you, too, microsoft!
Die in a fire, Mac IE.
Oddly enough: Town ditches lights and signs at intersections to reduce accidents and make it safer for pedestrians. http://rurl.org/8x5
In the first 4 sprints, if you're not breaking something every day, then you're not really working.
It occurred to me today how many of the lessons in The Fountainhead apply at least as well to web development.
Ron Paul: Thats un-American, and we need to use the power of the presidency to ... protect our liberties. http://rurl.org/8v4
Ron Paul: One thing I would remember very clearly is the president doesn’t have the authority to go to war -- he goes to the Congress.

Being in SNV is strange. I see people in the hallway that I recognize by their corp photos, but dont remember their names.

You know that scrubs episode where cox kills those people? http://rurl.org/8qt They died WAY too soon. http://rurl.org/8qu
this mouse gets into moods sometimes where it wants every click to be a right click. It makes me a little psychotic sometimes.
Ahh, sprint planning/retrospective day... as unproductive as a day off, but without the rest.
Heading to Orion happy hour
Why is RHEL our new standard if yapache doesn't run on it? That's the 1 package that every y! engineer uses and every server needs to have!
Numeronyms like L10n and i18n make my l33t-centric mind get confused.
PHP 5 did so much so right so why break the array/stdClass transparency? PHP Fatal error Cannot use object of type stdClass as array-grrrrrr
A cool thing about working at yahoo -- "cvs co" to see the new stuff that YUI is up to.
Missed URL's today, and too cheap to go out. I hate doing that. Cereal for lunch...
Nice thing about being Guy Richie: Madonna plays herself in your Madonna spoof video. http://tinyurl.com/yvtdkg
Three day weekends make it easy to observe the sabbath. Atheist sabbath = beer and sleep. :)
Playing Desktop Tower Defense. Perhaps the most addictive game ever. http://www.handdrawngames.com/DesktopTD/game.asp
always a bit sad when i leave after the lights turn off.
Running to an interview with a dojo candidate...
As soon as you can, spend as much as you can on a really nice mattress.  Your life will change.
YUI is playing football outside.
Crock via Smarr: You can make javascript into something else, but it's better to make Javascript into what it wants to be.

Slept on a real bed last night, bug free. The simple pleasures make the most difference in life.
Whenever Im out of the office for a day, it takes me most of the next day just to catch up on emails. I gotta get off some of these lists...
No time to get much more done.  Going home.
Still cleaning the apartment. Exterminators coming in the morning.
Sitting in an estimation meeting.
There's a giant y! mail guy outside my window.
Giant y! mail guy is for this: http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/08/27/ap4055720.html
More meeting.  No work today!
Watching Crockford's "JS: The Good Parts" http://tinyurl.com/ywt6yy
Scoping meeting.  (Hopefully it won't take too long.)
N.W.A. still kicks ass after all these years. I feel strangely old when I hear rap today, and miss the oldies like Straight Outta Compton...
Curse you, Mail.app!  Why must you corrupt the envelope index file?  Why must you complain about my home directory being full when it isn't?
Going over the product backlog so that our sprint planning hopefully won't take forever.
Need cold caffeinated bubbly sugar water.  It is my brain fuel.
Heading to sprint plannign
Out of sprint planning. Wrapping up stuff to go celebrate niece's graduation from age 3 and then odin's graduation from Sirius Puppy I.

Full of togos.  Back to work...
Headphones make people ignore you.  Even when they're silent.
Getting outta here...

You know you're using Linux when "step 3 in the documentation is the 12th step
And "step 3" comes chronologically before "step 2"
visitbread is up and running, and I feel more like a real yahoo by having a dev box without "santamonica" in the hostname
Finally got our cubes configured properly.  Sitting in a proper height chair and facing the proper direction. I'm an ergonomaniac.
Heading to dishdash
Waiting for IT to deliver my shiny new RHEL dev box.  It's name is "visitbread".  So long, tillnearly, we've had some good times! <sn ...

Just talked to a colleague whose job is moving to LA and doesn't want to follow it.  I feel kinda like a HS guidance counsellor.
Waiting for my ride home.
In another meeting.  Was going to skip this one, but the movers are shifting our cube around.
Heading to a user study.
My landlords have decided that they want more money. I'm about ready to break this lease.
Sooo... many... meetings.
Fleshing out requirements.
Much as i complain, these meetings have been amazingly productive.
Grrr, OSX decided to crash. Too many ups and downs, I suppose.  Starting up the Usual Suspects...
Writing JSON code
Hooray! foohack.com made it to the yuiblog's Blogroll.
Heading to bldg E.  It's a nice day for a walk, I suppose.
Heading to a user study. i must admit it took a lot of willpower not to get pulled into that one...
Ouch, stood up.  What a let down.
In the new cube in A. Sitting on a chair built for a shorter person than me. Nice view, but I miss my KB tray.
Finally getting coffee.
A bit stiff from hauling out the infested mattress and sleeping on the airbed. About to work out anyhow. No excuses allowed!
Tearing up while chopping onions. Struck by the poetic brilliance of the use of the word by/buy/bye in "She's Leaving Home" by The Beatles.
10 is too early for a stand up.
Damn, there is hardly any parking in main campus. My car is practically sitting in the sf bay.
At the dog park. A scottish terrier just "claimed" my leg.
Writing an install script to yinst our new baby.
Debating using phUGC vs RnR.
With all these meetings in different buildings, I swear I've done more walking than coding on this project.
Tagging my monitor with Trang's cube number so that the movers will move it.  (They seem to think I'm still in L.A.)
Recruiter called.  Asked for my email address when I wasnt interested. Is my number more public than my email? http://foohack.com/resume
Getting annoyed by a recruiter.  (Seriously, how many times to I have to tell you that I'm not interested? Stop spamming me already.)
Interesting convo with the gas station attendant about UI design. iranian-swiss mechanical eng., working till his visa expires.
making my favorite dock icons do the morning bouncy dance.
Yet another meeting. (-_-) . o O ( zzzZZZzzz ) Sooo... Hungry...........
Drinking coffee so that I'll have enough mental stamina for sprint planning.
Shit, a bunch of my sites are down, including a paying customer.  I'm getting less and less enthused with Dreamhost's up-time.
In Dreamhost's defense, they fixed it quickly.  (Sites coming back up now.)
Heading to A1 Router for Sprint Planning
Just got out of meetings. Finally time to do some work.
Discussing proposed CVS structure.
