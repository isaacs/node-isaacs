I grew up very close to a kind and socially gifted allistic sibling who taught me a lot. But the term is ableist. https://t.co/6mWjBai9n8

Fellow white SJWs: when your relatives say thoughtless racist shit today, don't be a dick about it, but don't be silent either.
Thank you
Please read this whole thread: https://t.co/M6StoU648B  People who bring up the "black on black murder" derail are racist and bad at math.
White people riot because of sports and pumpkins.  Black people riot because their children are murdered with impunity.
It's easy to not condone riots when you have the privilege of literally any other means to assert your right to live.
Potus: there is never an excuse for violence. Unless you're a white cop attacking a black child, apparently. Then it's excused as fuck.

No TRUE sexist would mentor women at a university. No TRUE racist would have a black friend. No TRUE homophobe would vote against prop 8.
Beware "no true scotsman" defenses of sexism/racism/otherwise bad behavior. Bad behavior doesn't care what lies in your heart of hearts.

THE POINT of a CoC—whether a conf, an OSS project, or a traffic law—is to make some behaviors "unsafe", for the safety of everyone else.

Real people are complicated, Newton no exception. Remember accomplishments, but also that they were done by a real person. #NewtonDayFacts
Despite building countless walls and few bridges, Newton wrote, "Men build too many walls and not enough bridges." #NewtonDayFacts
Despite not having much of it himself, Newton said, "Tact is the art of making a point without making an enemy" #NewtonDayFacts
Newton said, "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants" (Giants = Kepler, Galileo, Copernicus) #NewtonDayFacts
Newton wrote my favorite poetic expression of impostor syndrome: https://t.co/zUm4jLbuh3 #NewtonDayFacts
Today, ships at sea use satellites find longitude. GPS depends on accurate measurements of time and gravity. #NewtonDayFacts
Newton was on the Board of Longitude, dedicated to solving the most pressing technological problem of the day. #NewtonDayFacts
Newton considered himself one of a select group of individuals chosen by God to interpret the bible's prophesies. #NewtonDayFacts
Newton wrote much more about interpreting biblical codes than he ever did about math or physics. #NewtonDayFacts
Most people with the first name "Isaac" are in no way related to Isaac Newton. #NewtonDayFacts
If not for Newton's fascination with the occult, he never would have discovered gravity. "Action at a distance" is spooky! #NewtonDayFacts
Today, no one uses Newton's "fluxional calculus" notation. Leibniz's was better. #NewtonDayFacts
When Leibniz independently developed calculus, Newton started one of the bitterest flame wars the history of STEM. #NewtonDayFacts
Isaac Newton kept differential calculus secret for years so that no one could match his wizardry. #NewtonDayFacts
"The greatest love of all is happening to me"  – Avoid the passive voice. WHO happens it?

CommonJS : Node :: TC-39 : ???
#jsmodules Step 5: Build a package manager.  <fin>
#jsmodules  Step 4: Focus on delighting production users, making their lives better, rather than any "theoretical" necessities or concerns.
#jsmodules  Step 3: Say "no" to features 3 times as often as you say "yes".
#jsmodules  Step 2: Iterate relentlessly, with code running in production. Make an army of bugs, and fix them one by one.
#jsmodules Step 1: Ignore people who are not involved with that problem set. (Including and @substack and other noders, probably.)
#jsmodules Step 0: Pick a radically small set of problems to solve as simply as possible.
#jsmodules TC-39 should copy the process that made Node's module system great.

Consensus *feels* relevant, because when our software was written, the individual was much less powerful, and disagreement was often fatal.

Looking forward to the VP debates.  That's gonna be AWESOME!!
McCain just admitted to being involved in every national security issue of the last 20 years. I think that makes him a terrorist, no?
McCain: "I've BEEN to 9/11. I've reached across the isle, and talked to the families there, they gave me this administration's greatest..."
This is going all Springer, awesome. Obama: "Fine, move on."
McCain looks scared of Obama. Refuses to look at him. His strokes prevent him from turning his head. via @mabeastie
McCain: "I've been to Russia. Those damn commies can't be trusted."
Putin has 3 eyes...?
Can someone call Henry and ASK him what he said?
McCain: "I was wearing an onion in the war, as was the custom of the day, 'course we called em liberty peas in those days..."
McCain: "I haz a vrry long record. Let me show you it."
Obama pronounces Pakistan as "PAH kee stahn", not "PACK i stan". What is he, a muslim or something?
This reminds me of couples therapy. "Why don't you tell him directly how you feel about that."

Vimed the firefox-bin in ff2 to automatically use a different profile than ff3. Laziness drives one to creative things sometimes.

So, that was a fun 5 hours of meetings.
Funny. I was twittering Feynman quotes over the weekend, and now this: http://xkcd.com/397/
OMG, FF3 is so fast. It makes me feel like I've had too much coffee. I might have to switch back to FF2 just to prevent ADHD overdose.
Now that Firebug and Web Developer Toolbar are available for FF3, I'm starting to use that. (Sucks that my haxies crash it, tho.)

Do not let the Trump team eat in peace.  Let them have no respite from righteous vitriol.  Let them travel in pairs, eyes darting over shoulders.  Let them sleep lightly, in a new place each night.  Let their guts be turned over in anxious knots.  Let fascists eat ashes.
